Generating Indian classical music with LSTM or RNN and incorporating visuals for playability involves a bit of complexity. Here's a simplified outline of how you could approach it using Python with libraries like TensorFlow/Keras for the model and libraries like Music21 and Matplotlib for visualization:

1)Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. 

>music21
>keras
>tensorflow
>glob2
>matplotlib
>numpy

2)Data Preprocessing:

Load MIDI files using the Music21 library and preprocess them into sequences of musical features suitable for training your model. You'll need to convert the MIDI data into a format that can be fed into your LSTM or RNN model.

3)Model Architecture:

Define your LSTM or RNN model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras. This will involve specifying the input shape, layer configurations, activation functions, etc.

4)Training:

Train your model using the preprocessed data. You'll need to compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer and then fit it to your training data.

5)Evaluation:

Evaluate your model's performance using metrics like loss function and/or qualitative assessment by listening to generated samples. You can also visualize the training progress using Matplotlib to plot metrics like loss over epochs.

6)Generation:
Once your model is trained, you can use it to generate new sequences of musical features. You can then convert these sequences back into MIDI format and play them using the Music21 library.

7)Visual Playability:
To incorporate visuals, you can use Matplotlib to visualize the generated music in various ways, such as plotting note sequences on a piano roll or displaying a spectrogram of the audio generated from the MIDI sequences.
